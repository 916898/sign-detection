# Sign Language Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting hand signs in images or videos using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to recognize sign language gestures and interpret them into corresponding textual representations.

## Project Overview

Sign language serves as a crucial means of communication for individuals with hearing impairments. This project aims to bridge the communication gap by developing a system capable of interpreting hand gestures from images or videos.

The detection process involves several key steps:

1. **Preprocessing**: Images are preprocessed to enhance features and reduce noise. Techniques such as resizing, normalization, and edge detection may be applied to prepare the data for training.

2. **Training**: A machine learning model is trained using a dataset of sign language images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly employed for this task due to their effectiveness in image recognition.

3. **Detection**: The trained model is used to detect hand signs in real-time. Techniques such as Haar cascade classifiers may be utilized for detecting the presence of hands in images or videos.

## Project Structure
